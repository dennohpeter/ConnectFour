# ConnectFour
In this assignment, you will implement the game connect four. If you are not familiar with the game, please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four Briefly, connect four is a two-player game where players (red and black) alternate taking turns (making moves). The game is played with a 2-dimensional grid (typically 6 rows and 7 columns) and a player takes a turn by “dropping” a checker in a column that has a free spot in it. The checker drops down as far as it can (stopping when it reaches lowest free space available in that column; being stopped by either another checker or the bottom of the game). A player wins the game if they can position four of their checkers consecutively in either a row, a column or diagonally. If the entire grid is filled up and there is no winner then the game ends in a tie.
